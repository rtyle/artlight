Board assembly

	Solder resistors.

	Solder 90 degree pin headers.

	Solder the TSL2561 and Huzzah32 to the PCB using pin headers.
	Only pins that are used can be connected.

External components

	... for example, LED strips

	These may be controlled by the HSPI and VSPI signals on the four pin header.
	SCLK signals are on the outside, MOSI on the inside.
	Facing the board, top side up, HSPI is on the right, VSPI on the left.
	3.3V signals seem to work OK without a 3.3V to 5V level shifter.
	
	A 5.5mm x 2.1mm Y Splitter Cable should be used to power both the board and the lights.
	For example,

	Enough power should be supplied for both.
	For example,

		https://www.adafruit.com/product/1466

	A jumper across the 2 pin 5V-USB header should be applied
	to connect the 5V supply to the USB pin of the Huzzah32.
	This jumper should be removed when using a USB cable to flash or monitor the ESP32.
	The 5V supply should always be connected
	so that the lights and board share the same ground reference.
