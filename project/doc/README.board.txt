	... for example, LED strips

	These may be controlled by the HSPI and VSPI signals on the four pin header.
	SCLK signals are on the outside, MOSI on the inside.
	Facing the board, top side up, HSPI is on the right, VSPI on the left.
	3.3V signals seem to work OK without a 3.3V to 5V level shifter.
	
	A 5.5mm x 2.1mm Y Splitter Cable should be used to power both the board and the lights.
	For example,

		https://www.adafruit.com/product/1351

	Enough power should be supplied for both.
	For example,

		https://www.adafruit.com/product/1466

	A jumper across the 2 pin 5V-USB header should be applied
	to connect the 5V supply to the USB pin of the Huzzah32.
	This jumper should be removed when using a USB cable to flash or monitor the ESP32.
	The 5V supply should always be connected
	so that the lights and board share the same ground reference.

	As above, plus

	Two 47K 1/4 watt resistors

	Nine 10K 1/4 watt resistors
	Nine PN2222 NPN BiPolar Transistors

External components

	Cornhole LED lights (for frame only, LEDs replaced with DotStar strip).

	Two RGB LED Lit Momentary Switches

		https://www.adafruit.com/product/3423

	One RGB LED Lit On/Off Switch

		https://www.adafruit.com/product/3424

	For maximum brightness,
	the LEDs in these switches should be driven by 5V, not 3.3V.
	ESP32 3.3V PWM is used to switch the 5V load through
	a 10K resistor driving the base of an PN2222 NPN transistor.

	Two IR Break Beam Sensors (for hole, wired in parallel)
