This repository supports similar microprocessor-controlled applications
that artfully control individually addressable LEDs.

Currently, there is a corhole and a clock application for this repository.

## Clock

## Cornhole

## Hardware

The common hardware consists of
* [ESP32 board](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3405)
* [TSL2561 digital light sensor breakout](https://www.adafruit.com/product/439)
* [DotStar digital LED strips](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2241)
* [2.1mm DC barrel jack](https://www.adafruit.com/product/373)

### Clock hardware
